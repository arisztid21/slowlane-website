                        As a baby i grew up around cars. My dad cruised and so did his dad and mom before him.
                        My dad and tios owned a paint and body so there was always something with cars happening in my family.
                        I've always been dedicated to the lowriding lifestyle, fixing and restoring cars been an interest, just watching the process
                        of a car being restored to its original glory if not better from start to finish. Lowriding has always been an art for me, i always 
                        tried to out do myself from build to build. I've introduced lowriding to my kids just to another possibble door for them,
                         if they find interest I will do the best i can to help build that want, to continue the lifestyle. Lowriding kept me interested because 
                         i've realized that places where people didn't get along, it had them together to all share the common interest, because 
                         of that i've met and know so many people. It is a life i only wish to continue to pursue.
